They are are by far the cheapest and most convenient place to organise new tyres for an Eddy 30. So easy every time. Thanks again
Garages cancelled on us 3 times. Not BC fault but very frustrating.
"Bought 2 tyres then the appointment to have them fitted was cancelled by BC as they couldn't get them there on time. New appointment made for the end of that week. Got to the garage but only one tyre had been sent. Not happy, especially as MOT was due a few days later. Cancelled the BC order and bought direct from the garage"
"Great price , fitting when I wanted and that is why I keep using Blackcircles."
"Very easy service to use, tyres fitted at my convenience. Will use again."
Very easy to use!  Got my tyre ordered and fitted within a few days very local to me.
Good prices and choice of tyres allied with a choice of fitting location. I've used Black Circles on several occasions and can recommend them.
Really easy process from choosing and ordering the tyres to booking the fitting appointment at your chosen location. Quick and efficient service at the garage.
"Booked into local garage at a convenient time. All done promptly,  will use Blackcircles again!"
For the second time using black circles the appointment day and time was put back by two days which was inconvenient but as they already had my money not much I could do.
"Shocking. Ordered two new tyres, they were late arriving with minimal information from Blackcircle. I had to re arrange work commitments and very little sympathy from Blackcircle. I was supposed to be purchasing 2 further tyres but am very reluctant to do that now."
AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS Ordered tyres on line and within a couple of hours the cancelled my appointment due to not delivering on that day so rang and tried to make another appointment and they couldnt give me one so tried ringing them again to book appointment and same problem And there phone line kept breaking up when trying to speak to them.
My order was cancelled at very short notice due to their delivery issues and had to be re scheduled. This was very inconvenient as I had already put arrangements in place for the day I had chosen. Then when I emailed them with my new date I had to phone then to confirm it has I had no correspondence from them acknowledging the new appointment. The girl on the phone though was very helpful and sorted it out for me full marks to her.
"Easy to order, good choice of tyres and garages. Competitive price booked in quickly."
"Choice of tyre was easy and prices very competitive. Venue for fitting was less pleasing, the first venue could not confirm an appointment even though the website allowed a booking. The second had three bays but said they had only one trolley jack and so could not swap my wheels front to back as requested!"
A very easy to book online. Efficient and pricing was very good. Communication was excellent and applicable didnt spam me with marketing!. The local garage I used was excellent and in these difficult times was both professional and COVID safe.
On the day booked the tyre had been sent to a different branch so a wasted journey and taking time off work for to have to rebook when the tyre arrived
Bit of a mix up after being told tyres not available on fitting day only to find out they were there all along.  Went on next available day and order had been doubled up. Felt sorry for garage because they had to deal with the mix up. Have to say online chat worked brilliantly and garage were superb.  Would use them again.
"First class service all round. Great website and easy to use. Wanted top quality tyres and was able to secure a discount for my first choice. Able to select date and time a.m. or p.m. and have them delivered to my local garage that I use for all servicing, repairs, M.O.T. etc"
Rated 4 stars because of a delay in fitment and a change of garage but other than that quality service.
"sual easy ordering, good value and speedy and convenient fitting. Why go anywhere else"
"Tyres originally booked for Monday 20th fitting at 9am which was cancelled as the garage was unable to fit me in. In the same email they rebooked for Wednesday of the same week for 3pm annoying as I needed all 4 tyres doing but was understandable. At 4.52pm today the day before fitting is due I received an email to say the tyres have encountered a delay in delivery and will now need be rescheduled to after 28th July. This is awful service. We called Halfords who are now coming to the house this Thursday 23rd  to fit the tyres for 4 extra overall.  We called customer service, they did nothing to try and recover the situation and overall very dismissive of the problem they had caused. Will not be using this company again."
"Great price and local fitting a prearranged time,  highly recommended"
"Easy to choose tyre choice , fitting times when you want , good tyres at a good price!"
Tyres were 2 days late so had to rearrange my mot and garage dates.
"Easy purchase. The integration with Halfords Autocentres is very useful, but not yet fully setup, as there are currently some glitches - Halfords doesn't always seem to get the Blackcircles booking if there's been a scheduling problem with doing an extra service such as tracking. Once Halfords and Blackcircles get used to working together that would be a great partnership."
"Ordered tyres for my Citroen Dispatch based on performance ratings, booked my slot. Had an email to tell me my choice was not available after all. I was offered a different make which did not appeal to me due to the inferior wet weather performance, or I could choose a tyre under the Blackcircles Quality Choice label, which appeared on paper to have the same level of performance. Booked another appointment, then mysteriously received two emails confirming two appointments! Finally got that sorted out and had the tyres fitted at a local outlet. The tyres I received were made by JINY, a make I have never heard of before! Who knows what they are going to be like for wear and wet grip I could easily have saved myself three phone calls and five emails, and just rocked up to my normal garage and have them fit some cheap Evergreen tyres for less money.I won't  use Blackcircles for budget tyres again."
"Booked for a new tyre, as I always get my tyres from Blackcircles at local Mercia Motors.  As my MOT was due in July, I decided to add that service, instead of making a separate visit to Honda Motors, where I have my service contract..  I had no problem booking the appointment very easily on line, arrived at the time booked and waited in the refreshment area in the showroom, while the job was completed.  I had paid for the tyre on line as usual, and just paid for the MOT before leaving the showroom, by card as requested.  Everything went very smoothly and I would recommend Blackcircles to anyone who asked."
"The original fitting date was cancelled as the Tyre,s had not arrived in time.The Tyre,s were fitted a week later without any problems."
Chose tyres required online. Paid and booked  garage. Went to local garage on date at stated time and tyres were fitted in excellent time whilst I waited. All done and dusted. Was excellent service and will use again.
"Ordered and paid for tyres, selected fitting time and garage, tyres fitted. Hassle free simple effective service."
Easy to find and order tyres. Mobile fitting was available and undertaken in a timely manner by a knowledgeable and friendly technician.
Ordering the tyres and arranging to get them fitted was easy and straight forward with no problems.The problem was getting the tyres replaced at the tyre company.  Last company I used were excellent Hi Q who knows probably based on experience how not to scratch the wheel rim by using the machine with the inside wheel facing up so as not to scratch the rim.  Just Tyres did the opposite and now my wheel rims are showing signs of scratches and damaged marks at the high points - not impressed at all.
Quick to book and no waiting when I arrived for fitting.
Blackcircles were hopeless and re arranged my fitting date and time twice. There customer service was very slow in replying to me and didnt appear to take my complaints seriously. The garage I choose to fit my tyres however did a great job.
I didnt get the appointment Id initially paid for as the garage turned out to be fully booked. That said it was very short notice and black circles sorted a new appointment swiftly. The garage team were very friendly and got the job done fast. It would have been a five star rating if the appointment details hadnt changed. Highly recommended and great service
"Im very upset I have to write this review as I am normally not one to complain, however this is most abysmal service I have ever came across. They could not provide the service Ive paid for. Advisors do not read emails or listen to their customers.Booked for 1 tyre to be supplied to my local garage with plenty if time ordered Monday to be fitted on the Saturday. They cancelled late Friday afternoon. At first I thought fair enough, we are in a pandemic And asked to be rearranged for the following Saturday. They replied saying the garage had no appointments available. I went on blackcircles website and the garage I had chosen has appointments for this Saturday!I then called them I now wish I hadnt bothered, and spoke to a gentlemen who tried calling the garage to arrange an appointment, but couldnt get through to them and advised me he will contact me when he tried again later. How silly of me to believe a national company like this would actually call me back. Not a peep from them since.I have also stated many times I can only Do a Saturday appointment and I have had emails asking is a weekday appointment suitable Can I ask do your agents read emails and notes on the systems as I have stated this on almost every contact since the original was cancelledFinally I received an email today from my original email which has already been responded to by an advisor asking me to attend of a Monday. Obviously again did not listen or read my emails.I can see from the reviews on this site, if you make a booking and you get the original appointment great! However if you have a problem dont expect them to resolve this in a timely manner.I am now going to be asking for a refund and will not be using or recommending this company again, as they cannot deliver the service they have promised.pdate: changed rating from 1 Star to a 3 Star.We agreed to have tyre suppled and fitted by another garage today and went smoothly as expected from there.I have had a response to this review by a complaint handler who has apologised for the issues and offered a partial refund and discount off next order."
Simple and easy to order and book local fitting.
Good selection of tyres. Easy to arrange online. Good service at garage.
"Easy to book online, plenty of choice for places to have the tyre fitted and fitter very helpful"
"Easy to order, tyre was at garage at time arranged, garage were good."
"Arranged time and date altered twice by Black Circles, not great. Happened time before as well."
No problems.  Easy to book.  Dropped car.  Grabbed a coffee.  Picked up car.  Done.
Tyres arrived a day late so missed my appointment When I got another appointment the garage told me I would have to leave my car with them all day for a 30min job  after refusing that finally got a 2hr slot 2 days later from now on I'll just buy Tyres from the local garage as I only saved 12
Easy to book online and at prices that can't be beaten.
"Great price, ordered, confirmed, booked in and then an email 3 days later & just before the end of the day to say can't install for the booked time and may be another 3 days. Phone lines too busy and therefore have gone elsewhere.pdate: standard response given and following the call they are clearly selling stock they don't have."
"Booking through the website is very easy, as is choosing a date for the tyre fitting. nfortunately that is where the ease of use ends.I booked a mobile fitter for Friday 31st July. Despite getting a confirmation through, no one showed up.After contacting Black Circles via the chat app I was told that the appointment would be rescheduled to Tuesday.4th August. On Monday 3rd I contacted them to make sure it was happening and they had no record of the booking !Now being offered next Friday as the next opportunity.I can understand businesses being under stress in these times, but then change the booking system to compensate. Looks like a company with a nice shiny front and struggling at the back !"
Simple and efficient service. Ordered tyres I wanted and booked my appointment for Monday morning over the weekend. On arrival at my allotted time the garage was expecting me. everything was done correctly and efficiently.  I will definitely use this service and SGT again for my tyres.
"Booked for a weeks time, night before tyre fitting date I got an email saying it was delayed for a further 4 days time, at which point I cancelled the booking."
"Great service, easy to order and arrange fitting. The guys at Total tyres looked after my mothers car and made sure she was comfortable with their working practices during COVID-19 as she was self isolating. Very pleased with Blackcircles"
"Sorry again but I have already written a review of my experience. Had got a date for new tyre to be fitted, then changed to a date which was after my MOT booking"
"All aspects of my enquires, order and fitting schedule reflects reassurance that all that is required from Blackcircles will occur."
Good value and easy to use. I had to ring the local garage to find out exact drop off/ collect time. The systems didn't seem to join up
Perfect! Great service.
"Easy to order online,  appointment easy to arrange excellent prices what more do you need."
"Tyres got delivered to a garage near me,blackcircles booked the appointment and kept me informed through every step. All my family use blackcircles for their price and service.great job."
A quick fix to a tyre damaged by raised ironworks.  Easy to book a local fit. Seamless transaction.
Process to choose tyre and book a fitting is as easy and straightforward as usual with Blackcircles.I got the usual excellent service at 3X for fitting.Can't fault the process.
I  booked my appointment on the internet  and received first class treatment.Well done
"Bought 4-avon zv7 tyres. 1.Tyres itself are not the best, on the motorway you constantly go from one side to another-float, steering delay is massive, sometimes it becomes scary to drive. 2.Dont reccoment to choose Hallfords in Barking, took 2 days to fit 4tires:first couldn't find my booking, then been told that short of staff and in the evening received a call that will be ready following working day. Client service is rubbish."
"I ordered tyres for my Mazda 3. The day before the agreed fitting date I received an email saying with apologies the tyres weren't available. I was then given another date and, sure enough, this was cancelled as well. I ended up spending the best part of an hour making numerous calls to customer services but despite the promises of immediate service, better quality tyres at the same price, I was still left without tyres or a fitting date. Eventually I visited the designated fitting centre and was told that they had offered an alternate supplier but were still awaiting a reply.  Awful service and a waste of my time."
"Tried ordering tyres several times to be told the tyres required are not suitable for my vehicle, as they are not an approved tyre, so why list them as suitable, I know full well what I need for my vehicle thats why i chose them, then get told they are not in stock or will be delayed after an agreed install date has been arranged, then when you try and cancel the order they ignore your correspondence.Maybe I was unlucky but for this to happen twice, dont think so."
very easy way to order my tyres on line and fitted by a garage of my choice and at a time to suit me.
Easy to book and excellent communication. The company pointed out to me a possibility that I'd ordered the wrong tyres  which I then had chance to check before the fitting date. The garage was very professional and I'd choose the same method again.
"Excellent, as always.  Easy to book. Friendly staff"
Blackbirds couldn't get the tyres to the fitters for when they originally scheduled the work. It was inconvenient to change appointments but to be fair Blackcircles did their best to sort it all out.
"I ordered 2 uniroyal tyres and only 1 was delivered, they've assured me 3 times with delivery dates that never happened, it's been over a week now and I'm still waiting for the second tyre, not good. Will never use Blackcircles ever again"
This is the fifth time i have used Black circles .And again great service except for this time after having the tyre fitted i receieved a text saying they were unable to supply the tyre on date required and would have to rebook fitting. I contacted customer service and explained to them that the fitting had taken place .two days later i got another text message for another fitting date. On the morning of the new fitting date i got another text to say not to forget the fitting.I contacted the fitting garage to check if they had recieved another tyre and they said they had not. So even though the delivery and fitting went as normal which was great i then wasted a lot of time trying to get to the bottom of the problem.
Excellent price and good how you can select your garage to get fitted
"Terrible service! My tyres were paid for and booked in for the 2nd of July, today is the 14th and still no tyres, after lots of phone calls/email, I couldnt get anywhere, so I finally had a call back on the 13th to arrange and reassure me that they would be fitted the next day, to my surprise I get an email once again cancelling!! Not acceptable at all! I have been treated unfairly and the matter is still ongoing!! Do not recommend them at all and I will never use them again!"
Good price fitted at my local ATS at a time and day i was able to choose.
"Choosing the right tyres for my car was very easy and the range on offer was extensive at a wide range of price points, including some premium brands at very competitive prices. Having chosen, it was very easy to pick a convenient nearby fitting centre and request a morning or afternoon slot. Everything was included in the price paid online so no payment was needed on the day I did not request any additional services beyond tyre fitting - you may need to pay the garage directly if you do ask for other services."
"good information concerning the tyre choices and garage options. I booked a mobile options and the tyre fitter turned up on time, replaced the tyres and took away my old ones as well. Couldn't have been much easier."
"You changed my appointment date, mucked me around, and then when I arrived at the garage they were unhelpful, unconcerned and couldnt fit my tyres! They said this always happens, and they couldnt contact me as they didnt have my number!"
When I arrived at the garage I was told Blackcircles bookings were not recorded in their system - I had booked a tyre fitting at 11 but my car wasn't ready until 5pm.
"No fuss, nice and easy method of purchasing tyres."
"There was a problem with delivery of my order for two tyres which was communicated to me the day before fitting.  It was communicated as a one-week delay which I challenged as my car needed the tyres to pass its MOT and I couldn't afford a long delay.  After two days without a further update, I emailed Customer Service with a request for action and marked it as urgent.  I received an update within 24 hours informing me the the tyres had been rushed to the garage and were ready for fitting.  I agreed to attend the next morning to complete the fitting.  CS came good in the end but it was a shame that it needed me to plead my case for urgency to get the right level of service.I have used Blackcircles since 2012 and all fittings have been completed on time and without issue.  The problem above is a first and hopefully a rare occurrence!"
"The appointment was 9:30 asked to come 10min,early it was gone 10:30 before the tyres we're fitted.Got the feeling the fitters are double booking for the same time."
"The tyres were with my garage the next morning when I only ordered them late afternoon.  Excellent service,  even emailed me to ask if I had ordered the correct tyres as there were options for my vehicle"
Good value and great service at the garage. Only downside was tyres didn't get delivered when they were booked for but good communication and they were rebooked without any issue.
"First time tried ordering tyres online, good choice good service, easy. Why didnt I do it before"
Tires took longer to arrive than originally stated so had to re-book appointment. Black circles then confirmed a date with me but a different date with the garage. I still managed to get them done on the day but had to go back later. Bit inconvenient and not what I would call a good service.
"Corona Virus seems to be the death of Black Circles.I have been a constant customer of Black circles for all our cars over the last 5 plus years and have had tremendous service. I was pleased with them that when our daughter needed 4 new tyres on her car recently I bought them on her behalf. The appointment was arranged for 2 days later. On the evening of the appointment she received a text to say there was a delay and to contact them. She did that the following morning  and spoke to their Indian call centre. The gentleman promised all sorts of things and said that he would check with the fitting garage. An email followed the conversation contradicting what he had told her, offering 2 fitting times and stating that both were unavailable. We have sent 6 emails to Black Circles trying to gain clarification but no reply. Eventually, our daughter rang the garage who stated that they have not had anyone from Black Circles contact them at all. She arranged a fitting directly with the garage. She says that she will never use Black Circles again."
Easy to book and arrange suitable appointment
Easy to follow booking system. Great service from the garage who even called to see if they could book me into an earlier slot.
"I have provided a rating of three stars because I received a very short notice by Katrina indicating that my order was going to be delayed night before the appointment with the fitting centre. When I replied to the email as requested to explain my concern MOT concern I did not receive a reply. The following day I called in order to cancel the order and request a refund. Bhushan from customer service was able to track my order and arrange for my tyres to be replaced as planned originally. 5 stars to Bhushan , calm, polite and helpful."
Good overall experience let down by confusion over booking date.
Very easy to book and company communicated well! The man that came to change my tyres was very polite and did the job professionally and very quickly! Will definitely use again.
Price OK but failed to deliver to schedule to the fitting garage.  Got notified the day before scheduled fitting and offered a new date 5 days later.  Not great.
Tyres arrived on time. Received an appointment. Tyres fitted. Good job. Good price. Very happy. Thank you.
"So easy. Go on line, choose your tyre's and where you want them fitted and what day. You get a time, job done. I have used them twice now, no problems. Like I said easy."
The website makes getting the right tyre from an excellent selection very easy and there is a wide range of fitters available to put the tyres on the car. I have used Blackcircles before and I will use them again.
"Good website, found the tyre I needed and booked a fitting at a local open garage.  Ordered on Sunday for fitting on Wednesday AM.  Late afternoon on Tuesday I received a message which stated that due to non availability lack of a courier tyre couldn't be fitted and to re-book for Friday or Saturday.  psetting as I had to change all my plans for Wednesday only to be told later on Wednesday that the tyre had now arrived!  So apart from not knowing when my tyre was going to be delivered my experience of Blackcircles was average.  However I WILL use them again.  Thanks"
"Our appointment was changed several times, but eventually we got the tyre changed."
Went with black circles because they were the cheapest and could offer me a quick installation at the garage. I then got an email the night before saying it would be an extra week. Then three days was added to that date. When I requested my money back the date was suddenly brought forward by 5 days. Over all good price on tyres but when I purchase them I expect them to be guaranteed for the agreed day.
Great tyres at an unbeatable price. Fitted on a day and time that suited me.I wont be going anywhere else for my tyres from now on.
"Ordered a set of 4 19 Avon ZX7s which I am very happy with, great price from BlackCircles and as always very easy to order online. Slight problem with scheduling the fitting with my local garage which took a few days to resolve and is the only reason Ive given 4 stars, as I missed an MOT date and had to buy a rather expensive last minute spare. All resolved amicably with BC by phone though. Have used Black Circles before and always had excellent service and will do so again in future."
sed black circle before ... slight issue with the day I requested to have tyres fitted .. was told slot wasnt available ... but convenient day organised at a later date and all good.Would use again ...
"Great communication, easy to organise even to change the appointment time, very competitive prices, never used blackcircles before would certainly use them in the future"
Good prices and service. Fitting garage local and all completed to time and date selected.
Booked an appointment to have my tyres fitted via the Blackcircles website to find out that the time booked was not available. Subsequently was told the earliest appointment was three days later and to respond by 1pm with a new date I was available. So I did but to find out that the date has been pushed back a further week. I had my car booked in for an MOT so needed the tyres fitted. Luckily got them fitted the day before the MOT but it was not an ideal situation. Disappointing as I had heard good things about Blackcircles and could have got the tyres cheaper at Kwik Fit or Halfords.
All processes online were excellent although the first fitting appointment was cancelled the evening before because the tyres were not delivered. This was not an issue to me but may have been if car was booked in for an MOT in the next couple of days.Fitting appointment was for 3.00 pm. Arrived on time but didnt start work till approx 20 past 3.
I had my tyres replaced at ATS Wombwell Barnsley. The booking was made through Black Circles. Excellent service was received from the booking process all the way to me leaving the service centre. I would certainly recommend Black Circles and also ATS
I am a regular user of Blackcircles and always find their prices good and like that I can get them fitted at a time and place that suits me
"Went to get the tyres fitted having excellent experiences in the past but the evening before they were due to be fitted, had a text saying they couldnt complete the order. This was very inconvenient and nowhere near enough notice. They arranged a date the following week."
"Competitively priced tyres fitted at a time of my choosing at a garage of my choosing, what's not to like"
Ordered tyres as cheap. Got an email from black circle to say appointment made at my local garage. Took day off of work and night before got message saying tyres were not in. Got a new booking 7 days later and again black circle emails me the night before they were due to be fitted. I emailed 3 times with no response. I phoned and asked to speak to someone from complaints department was told they would phone me back next day. Surprise surprise no call. So 3 days later and I phoned asked again to speak to someone and was put on hold they hung up on. Disgrace full. I am a key worker and my car is my only way of getti g to work. This is now coming into 3 weeks since I purchased my tyres. DON'T BY. I have now put my complaint to the citizen advice cause black circle won't talk to me
Trouble free process - even when I had to push the fitting appointment back a week. Wouldnt hesitate to use the service again.
Order process was easy and quick. There was a delay of a couple of days from my original booking but changing the appointment was easy and I'm very happy with my tyres.
Good prices and easy to arrange to get the tyres fitted.
"Best solution when changing envelopes. Organised, booked in advice and best prices"
I booked to have my tyres done at a garage and then you emailed me a couple of days later to say I couldn't have that appointment. It turns out the garage weren't doing Saturdays so I don't know why it said on your website that there were 4 available slots. Very frustrating in the current circumstances and meant that I couldn't drive to see my family for fathers day
"Easy to use website. Great prices. Seamless link to booking with partner tyre fitters. Tyres were ready and waiting at my chosen fitter, no issues."
There is good information on the tyres and it was easy to find a fitter.
Easy to use site aleo to pick tyres requierd and order and book fitting online.Ordered x4 Pirelli tyres as required entered didcount code provided for 10 off per tyre at checkout . No hassle fitting at local tyre fitters.
"I ordered a tyre and fitting online as I had a puncture. Time was of the essence as I was due to go on a trip at the weekend so I had it all booked in. Then  during the evening of my order I got a fairly unhelpful email saying the fitter would not fit just one tyre, it had to be 2, this was irritating as there was no stipulation online. After using the online chat the next day I was helped by a member of the team who sorted everything out for me and made it happen. Really pleased with the customer service, but only got that when I used the live chat."
Poor serviceArrived at allocated time and garage has a different booking time 2 hrs later!!Overall very poor service - will look elsewhere.
Had to change my appointment twice and they did it no problem.... was kept on hold for a while but I guess covid is to blame for this.
"They do offer good prices, but I booked in an MOT and the garage knew nothing about it. Bit of hassle had to re book the MOT. Still, good value for money. They did communicate via email."
"Easy to order online simply by typing in Registration number and confirming car then select make of tyre required. Tyre size already selected for you. Simply select garage and time for fitting. Easy peasy, will use site again. No problems at garage, car was ready within 30mins and no pressure to take extras such as tracking or alignment"
"I needed four new tyres fitting and due to the car was dreading the price. Blackcircles.com was recommended to me and for that I am thankful. So easy to use and great choice of tyres to choose from. Is great you can see the tyres you will be getting fitted and they're ratings. Also such a range from economy to prime so you are not forced to have the most expensive and can read other customers reviewsOrdering and booking in the fitting was so easy. I chose the option to be fitted at the house as working at home and booked my day.I can only give motivatiknal feed back. There is no developmental feed back I can giveExcellent from the moment I clicked on the website and I have already recommended blackcircles.com to friends and family and will for sure be using them again when I need more tyresFully deserved 5 starsRichard, Nottingham"
Nothing to complain about. Compared couple of other sites and found the prices are competitive. Ordered on 3rd of August and a slot was available on 5th at the nearest fitting centre. There were enough notifications and a text reminder was sent on 5th morning about the fitting. At the fitting shop everything went smooth and fine. Overall I am happy with the service received. I would use this company again.
Great service. New tyres and Covid safer.Simple to book and fitting Team were efficient and friendly
"Best way to buy tyres from start to finish, no problems just pay online pick a time at a garage near you.I had excellent service at  Campsie garage Biggar"
"I always purchase my tyres from Blackcircles. Website is easy to use, tyres are great value for money and whats more booking your fitting couldnt be easier."
easy ordering and booking.. Would use again
"No fault with website, price or delivery.However; you offered me a Saturday afternoon fitting at a local tyre fitter when they did not open in the afternoon!  Huge inconvenience as we were due to travel away the next day and had to postpone our trip until Monday morning."
It was very easy and convenient to order right pair of tires with plenty of option to choose from when it comes to a fitting place near me..
Easy ordering of compatible tyres for my car with partner garage to fit them withIn a short space of time. Would recommend to use.
Brilliant.  Easy to use and very competitive on price.  Great flexibility and choice of garage to fit the tyres at a time to suit me.  Will definitely use again and highly recommend to friends and family
"Tyres ordered and fitting time selected about 6pm Thursday evening after discovering a slow puncture. Booking arranged for following Tuesday. Email received after 8pm to state that the fitting could not take place on Tuesday and would be Friday at the earliest and asked for my confirmation. Chased with Black circles on Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday before they finally contacted the garage and informed me they couldn't complete the job on Friday as the slot had been taken. Only positive was a refund was issued straight away. Awful service in this current climate. Empty promises to ensure that things would be sorted before I was due to drive over 400 miles on holiday. Would definitely not recommend."
"Simplified process to order online. Great price with significant savings. Choice of 3rd party fitters in the area. Overall, a great purchasing experience."
The process for ordering was easy and seamless. The tyres I wanted were available and  I was able to select a fitter at a convenient location. The problem came when I was contacted by Black Circles to inform me that the fitter could not now fit at the time that I needed. Black Circles refunded my money without question and I was able to source tyres elsewhere.
"I love driving my car but hate when things go wrong, because I'm not a car person and I worry a lot about the things I don't understand. I spotted one of my tyres was going flat quicker than the others, and wanted to just replace it. Blackcircles showed me a bunch of options for my make and model, and it was easy to pick what I wanted and where I could have it fitted. Paying in advance makes everything simple, I showed up to the garage and they were expecting me they were a premier partner and had the Blackcircles signage up outside. New tyre fitted and I'm happy in the car again!"
"Very easy to book, very competitive price,  very helpful staff."
"Booked in, was changed but still ok. Dropped off car Im good time.  Job finish was more than 2 hours late wasnt a problem as were visiting friends nearby. Excellent product fitted 4 new tyres, properly done...saved money from just turning up or ordering in advance with the garage. Much cheaper than dealership fitting too...Could go for a better tyre as well!Worth doing to save money."
tires fitted to a good standard and in a timely manner.
"Would have given 5, BT when I arrived at ATS Huntingdon for my fitting they had no knowledge of my booking. Fortunately, they were able to still book me in. ATS Huntingdon were very friendly and helpful."
"Not a great experience sadly. I ordered my tyres booked them for the garage, date and time. Booked time off work went to the garage my tyres had no even been delivered had to wait another week and another day off work. When I complained the gentleman was polite but only offered me 10 refund for two days lost at work and being messed about no end. Turns out courier delivered my tyres to the wrong garage and notified no one"
Quick and easy to book at a competitive price without too much leadtime to get the goods into stock.
"Good value, quick and easy site to use with good variety of fitting centres to choose from."
"Ordered tyres for mot and service ,only one delivered on time the other one 3 days later, cost me a resit of mot. Not the usual service from them. No offer of discount or anything. Wasn't happy."
Bought 2 Michelin Primacy tyres at excellent price and able to arrange convenient local location for fitting them through black circles.
The process was simple and I found the range of tyres on offer and the pricing to be better than similar services when I shopped around. Plenty of venues to choose from which was great and I was able to find one within a mile of home. I didn't attend the appointment myself a family member took the car in for me but it was quicker than expected and communication was good leading up to it. Would definitely use again.
Blackcircles were very good when I ordered and arranged the fitting of the tyres . Mixed feelings about the fitting centre.
"brilliant idea of having a time slot, knowing that your tyre is actually in stock.10/10 for everything, efficiency, speed and especially to the chap who fitted the tyre and managed not to damage the black wheels"
"Brilliant site very easy to use, big saving on tyres also fitting appointment and speedy fitting of tyres....highly recommended"
Easy online ordering system with plenty of choice. Will use again.
Really quick service and easy to book. The tyres were good for the price.
Wednesday I Ordered two Tyres as I had a rare day off on the Friday. 20:45 at night I get an email saying the garage has said they cant book you in even though it had been confirmed. I replied explaining I have a rare day off and need to get the tyres fitted on this day give me another location no problem. No reply so I messaged again still no reply. Finally when I do get to an online chat the solution is how about we book you in from next Tuesday onward but Im working 6am 18:00 each day. Solution is refund wait up to a week though. What a poor experience and total waste of my time this was. They offered me 10% off my next purchase Im actually offended they think I would go through this again. So no tyres no money nothing good to say Im afraid.
"The worst tyre purchasing experience you could think of to be honest. I ordered 2 tyres to be fitted 2 days later at a local garage, then at 8pm the evening before the fitting date within 12 hours of fitting I receive an email saying they haven't delivered the tyres yet. Around 20 emails later i have to wait till Monday, then that changes to Tuesday, then Wednesday. They can't fit them Wednesday so I'm waiting until Friday now and had to use annual leave to make the appointment as I have no free time on weekdays 9-5. They've offered a 20 quid refund because of the disruption and delay but still yet to receive this, plus a 10% discount on a future purchase. I won't be using them again which is a shame as the tyres are excellent and exactly what I wanted, their ordering is the issue. nderstand the ongoing pandemic could be a reason for this but if they can't deliver what they promise then it's just not on for a company such as this."
"Nice and easy, this is my second time with black circles and still won't look anywhere else. The price is fair and easy to book the garage of your choice with time slot."
"Really easy to book, good availability and service was professional and efficient."
"Ordered Hgv 'in stock' tyres x3. Paid up front. Fitting appointment confirmed.I arrived at the fitting in Worcester with my lorry only to be told I wasn't booked in and they had no tyres oh and that the fitter wasn't there and he's actually mobile! 3 minutes later I got an email telling me they couldn't source the tyres and my appointment needed to be rescheduled along with an alternative tyre offer. Alternative tyres and appointment accepted. You can guess what happened next.. A repeat of the above. I've got an appointment for Friday now but I have zero confidence in them delivering.Having read other review sites, I have seen many saying the same thing over the past 3 weeks yet trust pilot is nearly all 5 stars HowEditI think that this speaks volumes. After posting my negative TP review, within 1 hour, there's a bunch of almost immediate 5 star reviews. Something is fishy. I can only speak from experience but look at other review sites and it totally contradicts these latest posts. I've had my money taken, driven a HGV to a confirmed appointment which they only supposedly confirm once they know the tyres have arrived, only to be told no appointment, no tyres and then having had 3 further appointments changed.To quote their own website :-'Tyre fitting dayTyres are delivered to your local tyre shop in time for the tyre fitting appointment you selected. As your car tyres, including tyre fitting, are paid for at the time of your order you have nothing to pay for on the day.' If they actually come through, do a good job of my Friday install, balance the tyres then I will update my review and rating, but until then, this stands.pdate#2Told them I could only do Friday, I was then offered Wed's despite prior mail. I need the Lorry. Decided to cancel and use a local Truck company as there have probably been 29 different emails on this all with conflicting fitting dates, locations etc. So far I'm on my 3rd refund request. I think they should stick to car tyres."
"Good price for the tyres that I wanted and an easy booking system to choose when and where for fitting.  Four hour time slot may be a bit long if your centre is in the middle of nowhere and no way of returning home, or going to shops etc.  Only problem was the tracking service that I ordered was not carried out on my orders and the reduction on the payment was not automatically applied.  I had to contact Blackcircle for refund.  The tyre fitting service did say they removed this item from the billing, so perhaps a breakdown in communications.  Refunded via paypal in two days.  Communications with Blackcircle via online chat was quick and easy."
I booked a session on a Saturday morning - July 18th. I heard nothing from BC about confirmation so I rang the garage who said they were full that day and we rearranged for the following Monday July 20th. BC eventually came back with another appointment but after the Monday. That particular procedure needs tightening up/The tyres are fine  up to now  and the garage were spot on with their service..
"Very easy to book, no issues taking to the vendor for fitting.  Perfect, cost effective, very impressed"
Embarassing mess.Ordered tyres to be fitted as normal.Day after was told can not be done at chosen fitting centre it would therefore take a day longer.Then 2 hours later was told tyres chosen were out of stock despite me asking the operator on the call to check they were available.This caused yet another delay of a further day while they found some alternative tyres.Should have had tyres fitted Wednesday.Had to wait until Saturday.Had no use of car for 3 days as 2 tyres were damaged.Very poor service indeed.
Very simple service and great I could choose where I wanted them fitting.Would definitely use again
"First and last time I use Blackcircles. Ordering the tires was easy enough and a fair deal. Getting them fitted is an absolute nightmare and the customer service is non-existent. First fitment date has been canceled seems to be a recurring issue as I read these reviews, they emailed me with an appointment made on my behalf 3 days later. As I'm not available that date I've been trying to phone and email them numerous times and 24 hours later still no customer service to be seen. Email has been left unanswered so I phoned and got put in the que for a call back. One hour later received said call but call disconnected within seconds, no return call from them. So I phoned again, call back in an hour again and this time the call ends within the first ring. Phoned a third time, waited to speak to someone this time and eventually got through to human who couldn't provide a solution but promised to phone back by 1800hrs and let me know how to proceed. This call never came so I guess tomorrow I'll have to try again.Bottom line, don't expect customer service here. You're better off booking yourself into a fitment center and just buying direct. I wish I had."
"Nice and eat to use, lots of places to get my Tyres fitted at a good price."
There was a mixup with the scheduled fitting at ATS. To make matters worse the on line chat facility only succeeded in making matters worse with more unsubstantiated appointments made with ATS that I knew in advance were not viable as I had already made a call myself
Very easy to buy and arrange fitting. Only disappointment was that purchased via Quidco.com and cashback was declined for no reason bad practise Blackcircles !!!
"My son recommended this company and as an OAP I found the website, selection, ordering, fitting by a local garage all very easy to do."
"An absolute shambles from begining to end.I was called literally 2 days before mobile home fitting to say it wasn't going ahead on Saturday the 25th of July. No alternative arrangements were made by me but black circles thought it would be a good idea to book me in again for, in their words 'sometime in the coming weeks after the 3rd of August'.  I told them this wasn't acceptable as I was going on holiday on the 3rd August... With my car. This was all done by email at their request they said 'please respond to this email'. nfortunately several emails, 3 calls to the online chat and two phone calls eventually resulted in me almost loosing the will to live. It was incompetence on a level I've genuinely never experienced in my life. To give you an idea of the call centre... 'yes sir.. We have a fitting centre in Scotland... Would that suit you' Errr yeah.... But could you be more specific They then told me my tyres would be fitted on the Thursday. Low and behold.. 6pm on Wednesday night... No they can't be fitted as our courier hasn't sent them!! They then said, we'll book you in for Saturday, but the tyres might arrive Thursday, Friday or Saturday!!! Eventually I had to drive my unsafe car to a garage. I ended up following my instincts. It transpires the tyres did arrive on Thursday!! Truly unbelievable!!Throughout the whole thing... Nobody took any ownership. Yet guess what.. Yes I got a text on Saturday morning 1st August saying please remember your tyre appointment!! The tyres were already fitted! Roll on 5 hours... Another email saying you haven't attended your appointment... Do you still want the tyres! You genuinely couldn't make it up. Overall, a shambolic affair and it's really put me off ever using them again.... I wanted a home mobile tyre fitting but ended up having to drive a potentially dangerous car to a garage... Negating the whole point of using home fitting. Very disappointing."
Good priceAvailability LocationFriendly staff.Time slots
"Quick, easy and efficient. Tyres renewed at a local garage at a time which suited me.Price was very competitive. Will definitely be back!"
You don't get a appointment at the tyre fitting centre. Instead you are face with the prospect of a 4 hour wait. Rubbish.
Bit of a mix up with the tyres at first but got it all sorted for a future date and car is better than ever. Def be using them again
"Absolutely disgraceful behaviour. Ordering easy,paying easy. Fitting date arrangements easy..until Black circles decide to change the date..Refund IMPOSSIBLE until I have to threaten Court action !!!!! I will not be robbed!!!"
"Simple process to order tyres online through Blackcircles and choose fitting garage.Arrived at the garage at the designated time as another customer turned up to be told that we had been 'double-booked' by Blackcircles.The garage wasn't ready for us and had to move some cars around to get ours in.Tyres fitted and checked - the garage staff were friendly and courteous.However, my only gripe was that my tyre deflation warning alarm went off within a few miles of leaving the garage; I went to a service station to check the air in all tyres to find that the tyre fitter had put the wrong pressure in both new tyres so the system was alarming as the tyres were well under pressure...."
"Website easy to navigate, find and select what's wanted.Prices and customer reviews there to see.Easy to select suitable time and fitting agent.Overall, good experience at a good price."
"Great quality tyres from a good selection. Excellent price with easy to arrange fitting, all quick and easy. I'd recommend you give them a try..."
tyres were delivered late to the garage was told id get a call in the morning to re arrange fitting of the tyres didnt get no call back so i tried to call still no update to went direct to the fitting garage and they were sat there and the garage fitted then i got a call back in the afternoon to tell me id had them fitted.
Black circles Site allowed a booking and payment for when the local shop/provider is closed.  I phoned the shop and told them I could not accept the alternate appointment they provided as I work full time and they said they could squeeze me in on the initial day provided I got black circles to cancel their alternate booking.  Black circles were very helpful in working in with me to get the booking changed manually as it cant be done online.
"Ordered 4 new tyres for my car and was pleased to get 25 off for the type chosen. Picked a local garage to fit and chose a timeslot. 3 days later, went to the garage and after about 1 hour I was leaving a happy customer."
"Great service. Only criticism is that I couldn't get an appointment time, but a window of 9am-1pm. This didn't matter though as when I got there they fitted my tyres straight away. Might be a bit more of a problem if they're busy etc."
"Have used BC many times before but unfortunately after my recent experience I shall start going direct to Kwik Fit or some other fitters.Booked 2 tyres to be fitted at local garage Welcome Garage, Stratford upon Avon and all went through and money collected from my account. Arrived on day of fitting to be met by bloke on reception who said we dont do Black Circles orders anymore, I havent got any tyres. He then looked on his computer and said oh yeah, weve got 5 more booked in today. Didnt bother arguing and he said he had told BC they dont fit anymore for them.  With that I rang BC who to be fair were very good in sorting out a fitting the following week at Halfords. I did ask if they were going to remove this garage to stop people getting same non-service and he said they would be speaking to the garage just checked and you can still book appointments to have tyres fitted there, so will be a lot more disappointed customers. I would have assumed they put an instant block on people booking this garage but clearly that hasnt happened.So next part of saga, arrive in Halfords a week later to be told they didnt have the tyres as BC dont tell them what they need to order. He said tyres would be in next day and get car to them for 8am and they would do it there and then for me. Arrive at 8am to be told no staff were there to fit and Id have to leave car. So I walked the 2 miles home and after 3 hours got a call to say they have been fitted. Another 2 mile walk and I finally had two new tyres fitted to my car.Absolute shambles and will never use again."
Good experience that could be improved by having a 2 hour time slot for mobile fitting
Fantastic easy to order and arrange fitting. Good price great choice
"Shambolic tyre purchasing experience. I ordered 2 tyres to be fitted 4 days later at a local garage, then 2 days before the fitting I receive an email saying tyres not available. Agreed to change them to an alternative tyre brand. Received another email saying they can't fit them on original date. Agreed to change date. Then got another email next day saying cant fit them offering a change of date and time. I replied saying the alternative date was not suitable due to work commitments and asked to cancel my order. They completely ignored my email. Had to call them direct over 1 hour call back. They didnt acknowledge my email during the call and assumed my fitting was still going ahead. Bit of reluctance from call handler to comprehend that fitting date was not suitable. Eventually managed to cancel my order. I won't be using them again. Couldnt supply the tyres and changed the fitting date three times...!"
"I was cancelled on twice because the tyres went missing. When I called to ask for a refund, they said wait till Monday to process the refund, they then called the garage and magically my tyres appeared."
"Great value, easy to arrange fitting at a local garage, time suitable to me."
Good system. I ordered my tyres online and then picked a nearby garage to install them. It went without a hitch so was a good experience.
Great choice of tyres at good prices. Fitting at convenient fitting centres at time decided by you. good experience all round. Will definiintely use Blackcircles again.
"Listed garages that didnt have tyre fitting facilities, rearranged for the incorrect time at new location too. Turned up and garage had me booked in at different time. Awful."
"The appointment was well managed and timed to avoid other customers, during Covid 19 difficult circumstances. The only downside was having to pay an extra 47 for tracking expensive for a 5 min job When youre buying 4 new tyres to be fitted, this should be included or be done at a discount.. If they say it needs doing while youre already there, youre over a barrel, because you cant start looking for cheaper alternatives. Surely, it should always be done with 4 new tyres!"
"Very disappointed. Initial booking date was changed. Then when I arrived on the morning of the new date, the tyres had not been delivered and I had no choice but to leave and chase up. No one called me back, no one apologised for my inconvenience. Spoke to someone on the online chat who was very unhelpful. Eventually got hold of someone when I called them again at 5pm. She rebooked the tyre fitting and said I would get a discount refunded for all the inconvenience. I never received this. Got tyres eventually but wouldn't use black circles again, far too many errors and no one even seemed to care about customer service."
"Informed tyres not available for fitting on the original date, very late notification that appointment was cancelled and then a delay before order could be fulfilled. Garage knew nothing of rearranged date when I turned up for fitting. Pretty poor."
Purchased online at a reasonable price and fitting easily arranged at a garage close to home.
"Great tyres at a good price. Fast delivery of tyres. TJH Auto services provided a  great service, fitted tyres at a time to suit me, were very professional and friendly. Would recommend Black Circles and will definitely use TJH Auto again. Thanks."
Good and helpful ordering and booking service ...
Very easy to find order and book fitting time at local garage . Highly recommended
"Ordered tyres but first fitting date was cancelled and new date set, during these troubled times it was expected but they did all they could and everything went well on second fitting date, very satisfied with this company, used them a few times and a very good company and very good prices."
"Worst company ever to deal with and worst customer service ever experienced! Allowed you to book a service at your home with a tyre fitter who was on holiday, then allowed you to book into a static garage for it to be cancelled 3 times. Then when asking for a refund to go to a more reliable company I was hung up on twice. Avoid an wont be in a hurry to recommend to anyone."
"I had 2 damaged tyres so didnt want to drive the vehicle. I have a lease car so specific branded tyres were needed and blackcircles was still the cheapest. I booked it all very quicly online and they sent a fitter to my home where the job was done quickly and efficiently. Although you get an AM or PM slot, I was able to phone the fitters and get an approximate idea of when they were coming which meant I could take the dogs out before hand. Doesnt sound like much but was important to me. Overall very good experience and would highly recommend them."
nable to get tyres in time to original appointment with more than 3 working days notice.  Only told at 5pm the day before appointment.   Next available time was 4 days later.
Easy to arrange great service competitive prices
"As all ways a simple way to choose your tyres, and then to choose where to have them fitted at a time of your choice, such a simple system, the fitters are all ways very helpful"
We ordered online and had the tyre fitted by our chosen garage at the time requested without a hitch. Good price too.
"Booked online for 2 tyres to be fitted to car. Received email of time and place for fitting. Paid for transaction. Arrived at designated garage on date and time, handed keys over. 30 mins later, job done. So, so easy and professional. Defo use again. Highly recommend."
"I ordered two new tyres on a Thursday evening, and choose a local place to have them fitted on the following Saturday morning. Quick, easy online system and around 28-30% cheaper than ordering direct from the auto centre which fitted me he new tyres, and from any other source I got a quote from"
"Great choice of tyres, great prices. Easy to navigate website.Choose a fitting centre on a date and at a time convenient to me.Smooth fitting process.Would recommend!"
The tyres arrived late at the garage so the appointment was changed. The original appointment was for one car to go in the morning and one in the afternoon so I could do this myself and not need to involve my wife. When the new appointment arrived by e-mail it was for them both together which wasn't going to work with only one driver so I e-mailed back to say I could only take one. J had no reply from black circles until after the appointment. Fortunately we managed with the help of the garage to get both cars done that afternoon. We then received a phone call and e-mail from black circles apologising for not getting the tyres fitted  please do something to sort our your communications with customers-garge- yourself.....we know the garage very well as they look after both our cars for other things so they were happy to help. Other people might not be so lucky !!!
"good value, suitable place to get them fitted and very quick supply"
Great experience. There was an issue at my chosen fitting centre that meant they couldnt fit my tyres at the prebooked time. One of the customer service team from black circles booked a slot for me 30 minutes later to make sure I didnt lose a slot and contacted me by email to let me know. Great initiative from the team to book a slot as close as possible to my original time and then check after to make sure that was ok. The whole thing was taken care of by the black circles customer service team.
Order was 5 days late and had no notification so turn up to the booked appointment through black circles to get the tyres swapped only to be told they are now coming in on delivery in 5 days.
"Booked a date then was told that garage could not fit on that date, Given an alternative date but no time. Called the garage on that morning who said they had no record of booking. Had to call Blackcircles who rebooked me two days further on. In all, it was a week from booking to fitting the tyre. Garage said I should have just come in off the street and they would have sorted me there and then,The one good thing is that Blackcircles did give me a refund of 10."
"Although tyre fitting booked well in advance, my chosen garage ATS Daventry Road, Coventry was unable to honour the time slot and was unable to offer another suitable slot for the next 10 days. Blackcirles however found me a fitting slot at Mr Tyre, Gulson Road, Coventry, when I telephoned their customer service.Mr Tyre carried out the tyre fitting quickly and efficiently and had good Covid 19 measures in place."
I have previously had no issues with Black Circles. Not this time though. My appointment was canceled 3 times even after speaking to a rep and being given a promise the the tyre would be there for the 2nd appointment.
"Kept cancelling appointment, took about 6 weeks to eventually get tyres fitted"
"I like the concept of Black Circles with an understanding of the tyres I am purchasing together with selecting a garage location and time that is convenient for me. The prices are competitive and it really works, all in all a great service."
easy to order  and at a good price and easy to pick a place to get fitted
"Ordered tyres on-line. Easy to use website and speedy acknowledgement of order, fitting arrangements etc. Good quality tyres at a good price. Will use again."
Simple to use website to place order and choose local garage for fitting. Appointment on time and great job done by Shirehill garage Saffron Walden. Really pleased used blackcircles again and do highly recommend to anyone else to use them.
Waste of time cancelled my appointment and when I eventually got the tyres they where of poor quality. I will avoid in the future.
"Black Circles web site is easy to use for selection from a range of tyres, with payment! Appointment made with Fitter, at the same time!  Tyre fitted at pre-arranged time without any problem. Well satisfied. This procedure is so simple and practical!"
Good service would of got a 5 star but a change of fitting date and not enough air in my rear tyres
"Best value by far for the fitted tyre, appointment scheduled and fitted at garage as planned. Im a repeat user and will be back next time I need tyres."
No problems from ordering to appointment to having the tyres fitted . Professional and thorough
I had 4 appointments to get the tyres fixed. The garage was brilliant couldnt be more helpful. But it took a week to get the tyres with canceled appointments
I needed some slightly unusual sized tyres but I got let down badly by a well known national firm with a 3 letter name who could not get what they promised me but never felt the need to tell me until the day I turned up to my pre-booked appointment. I tried Black circles who had a large choice available and who delivered tyres to a garage 50m from where I work with no problems. I booked tracking and an MOT on the website at the same time then left the car with the garage while I was at work. Worked out perfectly and ended up costing considerably less.
"I was quoted 143 per tyre to replace my 19 inch tyres with a premium brand. Ended up getting AA rated Goodyears for 117 each from black circles which included fitting! Nice and easy, pick a local garage and arrange for them to be fitted. Will use again for sure."
Good value for money and easy to book in at the garage in wanted. Would recommend.
"It was a very long process with changes dates regarding the waiting for the tires, and consequently, the changes in the meetings twice to install the tires. Very negative attitude towards the client."
"Got the job done in the end booked my usual garage on Blackcircle got there only to tell me they dont deal with them anymore,they looked online they Bcs had booked me into Halfords ended up a 2 hour wait not a happy bunny because there was nowhere to sit so had to walk about for a couple of hours  Im 67 and not to good on my feet so wasnt very happy I wouldnt use again"
Another visit to Blackcircles as my Mini devours tyres at an alarmining rate. Its such a simple process to order and book the fitment.. I used White Rose Automotive Alton as my No1 fitter and as before delivered a first class job. An esay friendly Company to deal with
"Prompt and efficient service, easy to order online and at a time of my choosing, using black circle saved me 70 against kwick fit, thanks I will use black circle again."
Excellent - highly recommend both the booking process and garage used!
Easy to order and arrange for tyres to be put on. Impressed with service and prices of tyres. Have used twice so far and would definitely use again.
"Perfect. Quick and easy install, bloke swapping tyres was awesome. Price was good could be 10 cheaper to contend with local garages."
"Got a great deal on a set of 4 Avon tyres. Arranged an appointment for following day at a local garage who were professional and a pleasure to deal with. All in all a great, efficient and easy experience. Would highly recommend."
"Initially booked my tyre fitting at a garage that doesnt deal with you... but sorted it out in the end at another local garage. I may deal with you again, but will ring round local tyre fitters first ..."
Arrived to for the booking which was for 9am to be told I would have to leave the car with them. On an industrial estate no where near anything else. Two hours later I came back as it was raining. Not done. Eventually finished and rushed away due to the weather. Tyres are fine but noted one of the dust caps have already come off and are not the VW metal ones I fitted last year
"Supply issues.Ordered tyres which then had the fittment date cancelled and moved four times, until I eventually cancelled my order, four weeks after initially placing my order."
"I have used blackcirles.com on a few occasions now. They offer a good range of brands and prices to suit everyone. They have always delivered on time, and if you choose the fitting option,  you can select a fitting station and time and date that suits you. They deliver your tyres directly to the chosen fitter and you go inattentive the time arranged and it's done - easy as that !"
Ordered 2 tyres with fitting turned up for the appointment to be told only 1 had been delivered and wasnt informed about this before I arrived after booking a morning of work to get them fitted so was very disappointed as I could of cancelled the morning holiday until the second tyre arrived as I had to take another half day to get the second tyre fitted so was very disappointed an will not use again as the level of information from black circles was none existent
Absolutely great service no hassle order tyres pick a time that suits you and that's it . Highly recommend
Tyres were ordered and fitting slot booked. The day before they cancelled. The slot was rebooked again only to be cancelled again. We had to get the tyre off another company because the it was booked in for it's MOT. Contacted them by phone and was told they would refund me. The refund hasn't come through after 2 months. manged to get hold of someone today and the it appears the order wasn't cancelled. Pretty shoddy really. have now been promised a refund with 3-5 working days...let's see.
All was good regards booking but I found the response to my emails to make changes in time & date a little slow. Overall good service
"Easy booking, good price, fitters were good too. Definitely worth a try"
I purchased the Tyre booked the dated I wanted it was changed a late notice I never saw it was changed so went I went for the original appointment the Garage was very goodMy brother in law had his cancelled 3 timesI was not told this until after I had bought itI would not purchase From Black Circle again
Was good from blackcircles but wasn't booked in correctly in place what getting it done for it then to take the while day to be completed
Good price good value easy to organise all went smoothly without any problems Staff friendly and helpful
"Late email to advise the chosen tyres had not been delivered to the selected garage, so had to wait a further week for fitting."
"Turned up to the garage requested at the time slot allocated bearing in mind this had been booked for a week, for the garage to say the tyres hadnt been delivered yet so they couldnt honour the appointment."
Easy to use website found the right tyres at the best price as well as being able to book my car in to get them fitted all at the same time.  Great!
Good price but received an email the day before we were due to have them fitted to say they wouldnt be at the tyre centre and we were given a day the following week with no choice. Not happy..
Everything was very easy from start to finish.  Tyre size is selected from your car reg. and you choose from several tyre-fitting garages. Service is excellent throughout.
"Great company. So easy to use, generally the best or very competitive in terms of price and simple to select a garage to install the tyres. Have used multiple times and would recommend."
"If I had my time again I would not use Blackcircles. Tyres were delivered late I was told the night before by email, when I contacted them I was told I would have a new appointment by email the following day. This never happened I then contacted them again to be told the same and it was never booked. A week after my initial booking I finally spoke to someone who booked me a new appointment. When I arrived at the garage they told me that I didnt have any booking. On 3 occasions I was lied to and communication was poor. I was compensated after spending hours on the phone to speak to a manager who thought it was good to offer me a discount on my next purchase. Like I will be coming back DO NOT SE!!!"
sed Black Circle twice now and I have been impressed both times. Will be using them in the future. Recommended to family and friends.
"First time user of Blackcircles and found the service provided very professional and it gave me the tyres I wanted at a reasonable price. The web site was easy to navigate and there was a good range of tyres available. The only thing I was not totally happy with was that the tyre fitting service I chose was first come first served rather than an appointment system, in the event though I arrived early and was served first and was happy with the fitting and the people who served me.All in all I will not hesitate to buy from Blackcircles again."
"Brilliant as ever.  I have used Black Circles on numerous occasions for tires and have found the ordering process online straightforward and the range of tyres available is excellent, covering every quality and price range. Getting an appointment with an approved fitter on line is also straightforward and the tires were always delivered to the Fitter in time for the appointment. The prices are good and the service provided by the garage that I use in West Ewell is particularly good. I cannot fault Black Circles Customer Service either when they contacted me over a small query with an order. Keep up the good work!"
"The service was actually brilliant when it was delivered. However the logistical arrangements weren't great, our original delivery date was cancelled at short notice. I had to phone to re-arrange and then I didn't get a call back to confirm as promised, I had to phone again. I appreciate current circumstances probably contributed to the way our order was handled and so I would use this service again. Really pleased with the tyres and the fitting service."
"Having expected a time slot for my chosen time of day, only to be informed that none were allocated and they ran on a first come first serve basis, I was sure I'd be wasting a significant part of my day there. However, I waited a minimal length of 15 minutes, as they were busy and the tyre was changed in no time at all. I would use this garage again"
"After searching various places for tyres, black circles were the cheapest for the particular tyre I was looking for. I booked a time suitable for me, when I arrived they took my car straight in and was done in just over an hour, as I was having all 4 done. No bad points really. Everything went very smoothly"
They couldnt honour the booking I had selected based around annual leave but did arrange an alternative and were good on price.
Good quality tyre at great price. Plenty of places to have it fitted.
"very easy to use site ans 20 per tyre cheaper than all the high street brands, although when I turned up at ATS they said my appointment was half an hour later than I had booked, the fitter siad its always happening when bookings come in from a third party"
"I ordered two 'Good Year' tyres for my Mercedes and booked a fitting slot in a near by Auto-mechanic shop. They asked me to come and pick up after two hours. After two hours I got a call from them that 'Blackcircles' have sent a wrong pair of tyres so we can't fit it. I had to contact Blackcircles again for new and correct tyres to be sent, which they did promptly but it resulted another wasted day for me. Tyres are very good quality and good price. But three stars I gave is due to inconvenience caused by sending wrong tyres initially."
"Great tyres, best prices fitment easily arranged always find the times very exact saves so much money iyll b back!"
"Happy with the service, but when you book it in garage, first available with all garages was 3 days later.  Did phone black circles about bring it forward by a day,, they said we will ring you when the garage received your tyres,, no surprises didnt get a phone call, so ending up ringing the garage myself, which they did get the tyres earlier, fitted them straight away for me, because I was driving around on temporary spare."
"The experience I had was fantastic. From placing the order up to having the tyres fitted, everything was straight forward .Thank you very much."
Booked the tyres to be fitted 4 days in advance the day before a long journey. Only to have an email over 24 hours later to be told they can't deliver as promised. So annoying when you have organised something and you think you've sorted it only to be let down. Won't recommend.
"A very good service despite the pandemic. It was easy to book the service online, and the tyres were fitted by a local garage who were excellent. This is the second time I have used this company. I am very happy with the service and the prices."
Easy to book and pay for the tyresFitted as expected Very easyWould recommend
Easy to organise and a quick turnaround at the fitters.
"Everything easy to use from choosing tyres and garage near us to fit them, to taking on the appointment day and having a helpful garage staff. Have used twice now for work van and car and would highly recommend. Thankyou great service."
"This worked out really well for me. To be able to everything on line with great communication and information provided via email, I got what I wanted at a reasonable price. Fitting was at a time and place that suited me and they were very professional and helpful"
It was easy to find the tyres I needed. There were plenty of options in various price ranges and brands. I could buy just one or as many as I needed. Easy to find a place and time to suite me. Will always use this service.
Normally spot on but this time took 3 bookings to get them fitted
Quick service. Easy to use.
so convenient to book a date and time. service is great and friendly.  no hassle quick service. perfect.
Very lucky to get a star.... Ordered and paid for 2 tyres to be fitted last Saturday. Received and email in the middle of the night to say fitting is cancelled and they can reschedule for 5 days later. I feel I was tricked into buying from blackcircles.com. I replied to their email as requested but no one contacted me back. I then had to contact them to cancel and was offered a 15 'good will gesture' that of course I did not receive.
"Wouldnt even give them 1 star.... had my car tyres booked in a week in advance, had an email the night before Friday night saying they couldnt deliver the tyres and my appointment would not take place!!! I need the tyres doing before a long drive to go on holiday on the Sunday morning... couldnt then get an appointment anywhere else at such short notice... when I rang to complain I pressed the 5 button for a return call so not to be on hold ..... they never even bothered to call back... dont use!!!!!"
Excellent prices and selection of tires online. Website easy to use making purchase quick and pleasant. Large list of companies who can fit the tires. Highly recommend.
"Excellent, easy to book, work completed in less than 30 minutes, no irritating mechanic telling you the various additional work they would like to offer to carry out when you do it through a dealership.sed before will definitely use again"
"Booked an AM appointment, my tyre was the last car Of the day to be changed at 5:30pm."
"Im realising I needed to replace the tyre, Black circles was recommended to me.From start to finish it took me approximately 10 minutes online to book the tyre change for the following day.The communication from start to finish was perfect, personalised and accurate.Within 24 hours I had a tyre changed, removed and the service was expert"
"This is the 3rd or 4th to e I've used Black Circles and its worked well each time; choose your tyres at home, book a time slot at your local garage and there you go, internet prices fitted locally."
"Paid in advance. Mobile fitting cancelled by Blackcircles day before 25th July. After more than one contact, rearranged for Wednesday 5th of August. No one turned up, emailed Blackcircles, no solution. Needed my car this weekend. Please help."
"Twice i have used black circles ans twice there have been issues with them delivering on the planned date, the second time affected a weekend away in the car."
"The centre was easy to book, offered excellent value for money. Covid-19 restrictions were dealt with well and safely. The centre tried to see if a repair could be carried out instead of a tyre replacement but the run flat had too much damage to the side wall. Waiting time kept to a minimum. Good service all round."
"Easy to organise fitting, tyres at a very competitive price, hassle free tyre replacement"
"I was able to get the tyres of my choice at a good price fitted at a tyre centre near me and a time that suited .   Selection and purchasing was easy  and straightforward  online ,will definitely  use blackcircles.com for my next tyres"
"Good service, however ordered tyres and arranged date/time to get them fitted. Later received an mail stating that tyres weren't available/were delayed which was slightly annoying."
Dad recommended I visit this website - it was all very intuitive to do myself after that. I needed my tyres changed on a weekend and managed to find a place to do that. Quick and easy at the chosen garage. Would recommend.
As always with Black Circles you get great value for money tyres at a time and place that is convenient to you. What more could you ask for
A very stress free experience.Huge range of tyres to choose from.Fitted at a garage close to your address and at a convenient time.If only everything was this easy.
sed Blackcircles a number of times and as always very happy with the price and the service.  I get the tyres fitted at my choice of fitting centres and can even book a time slot.  The other advantage is being able to see the prices of all the different makes of tyre suitable for my car.  What more do you want
I paid for 4 new tires with home assembly.  I receive the email with the day and time for mounting the tires twice.  the first week no one comes to mount the tires.  the second week the tire center they authorized contacted me saying that they only have two of the four tires ordered and paid for.  this is ridiculous.  after two weeks I still don't have the tires fixed and I have requested a refund of the full amount paid.  lost time I just hope to receive a refund soon.
Excellent service and prices. I was really impressed with how easy it was to book - and the garage was also excellent.
"Booked tyres on line with no issues & selected a fitting date 3 days later which suited my busy work schedule. Less than 24 hours before my appointment I received an e-mail & text message would have been nice to receive a telephone call given that you insist on a contact number being left at time of booking! stating that there had been a problem & that to save me missing out my date had been changed to the next earliest appointment another 4 days later. This was on a date which was no use to me & realistically meant an additional delay of over a week before I could next get in to my chosen garage. During numerous calls to customer services the reason given for this problem changed from a delay in delivery to refusal for acceptance of tyres from courier by garage obviously not delayed then and finally weve had to resubmit your order. With the need to source an alternate supplier who could actually fit tyres within the timescale that I needed I therefore asked to cancel my order & receive a full refund. Was told that this would take 3-5 working days to process. Pointed out that my payment to them was taken immediately & that I therefore expected the same courtesy to be extended to my refund. Even then it still took 36 hours & had to be approved by senior manager who claimed that they didnt have any payment details to process my request which is strange considering that you managed to take money from my bank account without difficulty. In summary, whilst the customer service staff I spoke with were extremely polite & as helpful as they could be the company itself proved unreliable & disorganised in the way that it manages its business. Do not be seduced by minimal savings - its not worth the hassle. Will never use again."
Easy to use service. Garage used is a regular for me because you are able to speak with personnel to discuss work to be carried out.
Good service. Helpfull
"Perfect ordered online to a garage convenient to myself and a time to suit me, then waited whilst they were fitted."
Good service all round. Website full of information to make an informed decision on which tyres would suit best and play about to compare prices. Numerous local fitting centres to choose from including the highest rating by local word of mouth. Everything was completed efficiently on the day of fitting. Would recommend this method of purchasing tyres every time.
"Good service. Easy to buy and book online. Changed tyres quickly and effectively. Polite fitters, will use Bletchley centre again."
"was very efficient and easy.  very happy with the service.  was very simple to book online as well, and timing ran to plan."
